Embedded systems we should be good at C and C++,Rust,Assembly,Java,Python,micro python.
C is the Most used Programming in embedded domain.


   c data types has two values 



~integer data type              ~float data type

*signed data(both + -)


**/char(1)

**/short int or short(2)

/long int or long(4)~~ int(4)

**/long long int or long long(8)

*unsigned data(only non negative)

/same as signed add unsigned before 
the data type


c doesn't decide the memory size of a data type it is based on the complier.
